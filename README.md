## Frontend CDN System

Core frontend structure and UI utilities used across my websites and client projects.  
This repository functions as a versioned CDN package for layout, motion, and lightweight UI behavior.

It exists to ensure consistency, speed, and clean structural execution across builds without relying on heavy frameworks.

---

## Purpose

This CDN hosts the base frontend system used in my projects.

The system is designed to:
- standardize layout and spacing across sites
- keep structure separate from branding
- provide reusable motion and UI utilities
- allow fast deployment with minimal per-site CSS
- maintain versioned stability for production use

All files are intentionally neutral and reusable.
